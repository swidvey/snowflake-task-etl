### Snowflake Task ETL Example
```
This is an example of a basic snowflake ETL task process.
This file shows a basic in take from an AWS to Snoflake. 


A task can execute a single SQL statement or a call to a stored procedure. Tasks can be combined with table streams for continuous ELT workflows to process recently changed table rows. Streams ensure exactly once semantics for new or changed data in a table.
